<h3>Brief about myself</h3>
<p>I am currently a sixth-semester Computer Science student at FAST National University. Alongside my academic pursuits, 
I am a passionate artist, finding creative expression through sketching and drawing. Gardening is another interest of mine, 
providing a therapeutic escape and fostering sustainable practices. Beyond academics, 
I embrace a holistic approach to life, and my favorite color, lilac, reflects my inclination towards tranquility and creativity.</p>
